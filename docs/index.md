# #redactionart

In 2016 while investigating the practice of redaction in ASIO surveillance files held by the National Archives of Australia, I discovered a collection of #redactionart. You can explore the [entire collection](https://owebrowse.herokuapp.com/redactions/tags/art/).

The story of this discovery [was told on Twitter](https://storify.com/wragge/redaction-art). There's more information in [my research notebook](http://timsherratt.org/research-notebook/projects/immigration-recordkeeping-and-surveillance/), and in [Turning the inside out](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4055013), a keynote I gave to the annual conference of the Australian Society of Archivists in 2016.

In 2017, I exhibited [The Redaction Zoo](https://vimeo.com/wragge/redactionart) as part of 'Beauties and Beasts' at the Belconnen Arts Centre.

As part of the exhibition, I turned selected images into badges and temporary tattoos by tracing around the original works and creating SVG versions.

The SVG files are all available [in this repository](https://github.com/wragge/diy-redactionart) for you to download and use in your own #redactionart projects.

\#redactionart has since been turned into [cookie cutters](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2379810), a [dress](https://twitter.com/BonnieWildie/status/874166580900274176), [iPhone cases, and t-shirts](https://www.redbubble.com/people/misskoko/collections/741004-redactionart). The story of its [escape into the physical world](https://storify.com/wragge/redactionart) continues.

The creation, discovery, display, and reuse of #redactionart is a reminder that the processes that limit our access to information are human in their operation and design. There is nothing magical about the ‘secrets’ locked away in government archives.
