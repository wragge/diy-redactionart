# #redactionart

In 2016 while investigating the practice of redaction in ASIO surveillance files held by the National Archives of Australia, I discovered a collection of #redactionart. You can explore the [entire collection](https://owebrowse.herokuapp.com/redactions/tags/art/) here.

The story of this discovery [was told on Twitter](https://storify.com/wragge/redaction-art). There's more information in [my research notebook](http://timsherratt.org/research-notebook/projects/immigration-recordkeeping-and-surveillance/), and in [Turning the inside out](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4055013), a keynote I gave to the annual conference of the Australian Society of Archivists in 2016.

In 2017, I exhibited [The Redaction Zoo](https://vimeo.com/wragge/redactionart) as part of 'Beauties and Beasts' at the Belconnen Arts Centre.

As part of the exhibition, I turned selected images into badges and temporary tattoos.

The [SVG files](svgs/) I created are all available in this repository for you to download and use in your own #redactionart projects.

Full file references are included to enable you to correctly cite each #redactionart image. The image filenames also include the file barcode and page number.

To make your own badges, simply upload the SVGs to your preferred laser cutting service. (I used [Online Laser Cutting](https://onlinelasercutting.com.au/)). Of course you can resize them as necessary in a vector graphics editing program.

For the tattoos I used [StrayTats](https://www.straytats.com/). I had to fill in the SVG outline and save as a JPG for upload.

If you make use of these files please share them using the [#redactionart](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23redactionart) tag (you could also star this repository).

**Have fun!**
